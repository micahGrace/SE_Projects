Denial of Service is simply a service or application that’s usually 
reachable is not reachable – likely because of an attack and not a simple 
bug.The reason of a Denial of Service can simply be a random malfunction of 
For example, a person with malicious intent would send a specifically crafted 
command to the application designed to make it crash, effectively resulting in 
a Denial of Service.the service or application or a malfunction triggered by an exploit. 

A simple Denial of Service attack usually originates from a single or very few 
sources – the source normally being a server or PC connected to the internet. 
A DoS attack normally aims at vulnerabilities in an application that would result 
on a DoS or tries to overload CPU or RAM resources of the target machine.

I used java to implement the Dos Attack by sending 2000 threads. But the target application 
crushes before Even reaching those number of requests. 

After running the application you need to enter the url of the target site or application in the
"http://example:port" so that you would get the target application attacked.

Then the application send requests to the Target application and then do the Job to be done.
